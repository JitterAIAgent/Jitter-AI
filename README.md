# Jitter

Jitter is a simple, modular framework for building conversational AI agents with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and multi-provider support (Google Gemini, OpenRouter, etc.).

## How to Use

1. **Set up your environment:**
   - Run the setup script to create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     python setup.py
     ```
   - Follow the printed instructions to activate your environment before starting Jitter.
   
2. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Copy the provided `.env Example` file and edit it to add your API keys and model values for Google or OpenRouter.
   - Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_MODEL_ID`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, and `GOOGLE_MODEL_ID` as needed.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


3. **Create your agent:**
   - Copy and edit the provided being template (e.g., `being.json example`) to define your agent's character, knowledge, and style.
   - Place your being file in the `beings` directory (e.g., `beings/your_agent.json`).
   - Add any `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.html`, `.csv`, or `.md` files to the `files` folder for extra knowledge (RAG).



4. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   python main.py --being your_agent
   ```
   - Replace `your_agent` with the name of your being file (without `.json`).
   - If you do not specify `--being`, the default agent will be loaded.
   - The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.


5. **(Optional) Start the client:**
   - After starting your agent, open a new terminal window.
   - Change directory to the `client` folder:
     ```bash
     cd client
     ```
   - Start the client:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

6. **Chat with your agent:**
   - Use the `/message` endpoint to send messages and get responses.
   - Use the `/being` endpoint to see your agent's details.

## Features
- Easy agent customization via `being.json` (character, knowledge, style)
- Supports RAG from `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.html`, `.csv`, `.md` files
- Multi-provider: Google Gemini, OpenRouter, and more
- Add custom tools/functions for your agent to use
