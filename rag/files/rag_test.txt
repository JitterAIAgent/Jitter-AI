Jing Jin, the Friendly Orange Snake

In the lush, sun-dappled jungles of Yunnan, where birds chirped lullabies and bamboo danced with the wind, there slithered a snake unlike any other. His name was Jing Jin, and he was bright orange—the color of sunrise and sweet mangoes.

But Jing Jin wasn’t just known for his brilliant hue—he was known for being friendly. While other snakes hissed and slinked away from the forest folk, Jing Jin would wave his tail in greeting, offer directions, and even help lost animals find their way.

One day, a baby panda named Mei got separated from her mother during a game of hide and seek. The jungle was big and loud, and Mei began to cry. That’s when she heard a soft voice say,
“Don’t cry, little one. You’re not alone.”

Mei blinked and saw Jing Jin coiled gently on a mossy rock, smiling with his bright eyes.

“I’m Jing Jin,” he said, “and I’ll help you get home.”

Mei sniffled. “But the forest is too big! What if we get even more lost?”

Jing Jin laughed kindly. “I may be long and low, but I know every corner of this jungle.”

And so they set off—Jing Jin slithering smoothly, Mei riding on his back. Along the way, they met a chattering monkey who pointed the way to the bamboo grove, a sleepy owl who confirmed they were close, and a butterfly who flitted above them like a guide star.

Finally, at the edge of the forest, Mei heard her mother’s worried calls. With a joyful squeal, she ran into her mother’s arms.

“Who brought you back?” her mother asked.

Mei turned and pointed at Jing Jin, who gave a shy wave with his tail.

“That’s Jing Jin,” she said. “The friendly orange snake.”

From that day on, Jing Jin was no longer just a curious forest legend—he was a hero. And every animal knew: if you were ever in trouble, the orange snake with the kind heart would be there to help.
